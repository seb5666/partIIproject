# Brain tumour segmentation using CNNs.

This repository contains a set of CNN models, data pre-processsing and post-processing scripts, training scripts and evaluation scripts to segment brain tumours. 

The work was done in the context of my [Part II project](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/projects/) (Bachelor's thesis).

## Dataset and problem specification
The dataset used and the segmentation regions used are those given by the [BraTS2013 Challenge](http://martinos.org/qtim/miccai2013/).

## Write-up
The write-up of my project can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/seb5666/partIIdissertation).
